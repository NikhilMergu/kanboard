Administrators can convert a private project to a multiple users project by changing the checkbox "Private project".
You can also do the opposite action converting a multiple users project to a private project.

This checkbox **enable or disable user managements for the project**.

Note: When you make a project private, all existing users will still have access to the project.
Adjust the list of users according to your needs.
